abstract: "This paper adds a network dimension to locational theories on multinational corporate strategy
to explain how tax havens and offshore financial centers (THOFC) are integrated into the
structures of firms listed on five stock exchanges of the Asia-Pacific region. Applying network
analysis to firm-subsidiary connections of these listed firms, it highlights differences in the
connectivity structures as well as the role of THOFC in exchange subnetworks. It finds
considerable variation in the complexity of corporate structures by stock exchange can be
explained by national context and multinational location strategies, and that the prevalence of
THOFC within corporate structures cannot be underestimated."
