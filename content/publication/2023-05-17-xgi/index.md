abstract: CompleX Group Interactions (XGI) is a library for analyzing higher-order networks. Such networks are used to model interactions of arbitrary size between entities in a complex system. This library provides methods for building hypergraphs and simplicial complexes; algorithms to analyze their structure, visualize them, and simulate dynamical processes on them; and a collection of higher-order datasets. XGI is implemented in pure Python and integrates with the rest of the Python scientific stack. XGI is designed and developed by network scientists with the needs of network scientists in mind.
