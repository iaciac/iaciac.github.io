abstract: This paper investigates the role of tax havens and offshore financial centres (THOFC) in the global economy. Network analysis of 24 industry sectors suggests that THOFC feature prominently in knowledge-intensive activities such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and semiconductors, and are least significant in industrial activities such as automobiles and consumer durables, and place-bound activities such as real estate and retailing. Contrasting with the notion that most THOFC are ‘rogue’ offshore territories, the most significant are either continental nation-states or British territorial dependencies. It is concluded that global firm networks often mimic the geographies of taxation more than actual production or consumption activities.
