Wrapping up

<!--more-->

What an incredible week! A huge thank you to the 450+ researchers who joined us at the **University of Exeter** and **Northeastern University London** last week to celebrate the 20th edition of the [Conference on Complex Systems (CCS) 2024](https://ccs24.cssociety.org/)!

Organizing such a large-scale event in such a short time was definitely a challenge, but it all came together beautifully thanks to the support of the [Complex Systems Society](https://cssociety.org/home), the entire community, our dedicated [organizing team](https://ccs24.cssociety.org/contact/#conference-committee), and all the incredible [volunteers](https://ccs24.cssociety.org/contact/#volunteers-committee). 
A special shout-out to the conference chairs, [Federico Botta](https://federicobotta.github.io/) and [Riccardo Di Clemente](https://www.riccardodiclemente.com/), and my co-program chair [Ronaldo Menezes](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/staff/rm660?sm=rm660) ---it‚Äôs been an absolute pleasure working alongside you over the past months to bring this event to life! 

Over the many plenary sessions and the nine parallel sessions that run through the different days of the conference we heard about mental lexicon, hunter-gatherers social structures, systemic risk in financial and production networks, urban systems and human mobility, epidemic spreading and health, political systems, misinformation, the dynamics of online and offline social networks, evolutionary dynamics of biological systems, ecologicy and biosecurity, animal behaviour and more.
We were honored to have such an outstanding lineup of keynote and invited speakers, making this one of the most interdisciplinary conferences I've ever attended. A massive thank you to: [Tomaso Aste](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/tomaso_aste/), [Andrea Bamberg Migliano](https://www.migliano-uzh.com/), [Alain Barrat](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~barrat/), [Nina Fefferman](http://feffermanlab.org/), [Gourab Ghoshal](https://gghoshal.pas.rochester.edu/), [Suzy Moat](https://datasciencelab.co.uk/), [Alex 'Sandy' Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/), [Fabiana Zollo](http://unive.it/persone/fabiana.zollo), [Alex Arenas](https://webs-deim.urv.cat/~alexandre.arenas/), [Richard Blythe](https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~rblythe3/), [Giulio Cimini](https://www.giuliocimini.com/), [Luca Pappalardo](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/people/pappalardo-luca), [Cynthia Siew](https://csqsiew.netlify.app/), [Brooke Foucault Welles](https://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/), and [Karoline Wiesner](https://www.dashunwang.com/).

**Warm-up event**

During the weekend before the main conference, we hosted a warm-up event at [Northeastern University London](https://www.nulondon.ac.uk/) sponsored by the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). This 2-days long warm-up session organised by the [Young Researchers of the Complex Systems Society](https://yrcss.cssociety.org/) brought more than 80 early-stage researchers to the beautiful London campus of NUL.
