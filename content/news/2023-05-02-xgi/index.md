XGI: Comple(X) (G)roup (I)nteractions

<!--more-->

Comple(X) (G)roup (I)nteractions (XGI) is a new Python package for the representation, study and visualization of complex systems composed by units that interact in groups of arbitrary size (not necessarily in dyads). Strongly inspired by [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/), [XGI](https://xgi.readthedocs.io/ ) allows the user to encode higher-order interactions into hypergraphs and simplicial complexes (see [[Phys. Rep. 2020]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2020.05.004) for a comprehensive review on the topic ---or a [3 min](https://iaciac.github.io/post/beyond/) summary).
