"Creative Connectivity Project - A network based approach to understand correlations between interdisciplinary group dynamics and creative performance" is now published on **E&PDE 2019**, Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. 12th -13th September 2019. 

An *interdisciplinary* collaboration with the [Innovation Design Engineering](https://www.rca.ac.uk/schools/school-of-design/innovation-design-engineering/) programme at [The Royal College of Arts](https://www.rca.ac.uk/), together with [S. Torrisi](https://www.rca.ac.uk/more/staff/savina-torrisi/), [S. Manfredi](https://www.docenti.unina.it/#!/professor/53414241544f4d414e46524544494d4e465342543734503235463833394d/riferimenti) and [V. Latora](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~latora/), where we look at teamwork and performance during the student projects. 

The first case study shows that high self-reported team productivity is associated with low final marks.
