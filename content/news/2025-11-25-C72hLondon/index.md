Complexity 72h is dropping anchor in London! ⚓️🇬🇧

What is C72h? A week-long immersive [workshop](https://complexity72h.com/) where early-career researchers team up to tackle a complex systems project —from theory to applications.

*Do you want to lead a team?* Apply [here](https://complexity72h.com/projects/) to be a TUTOR by December 22nd, 2025.

You will work at the beautiful [Northeastern University London](https://www.nulondon.ac.uk/) campus right on the historic docks of the River Thames! Take a look at the [Virtual Tour](https://scene3d.co.uk/portfolio/devon-house-virtual-tour/).

You will "rest" at [Chapter Spitalfields](https://www.chapter-living.com/properties/east/spitalfields), a hotspot of East-London hipsterism and nightlife, just a short walk from the campus.
