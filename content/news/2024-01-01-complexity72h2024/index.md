Join me in Madrid!

Young researchers in Complex Systems, **Complexity72h** is now [open for applications](https://complexity72h.com/)!


C72h is an interdisciplinary workshop where participants form teams and carry out projects in 72 hours, aiming at producing and publishing online a report of the work done by the end of the 72h.

Collaborations born during previous editions led to peer-reviewed publications: [this one](https://iaciac.github.io/publication/non-selective-distribution-of-infectious-disease-prevention-may-outperform-risk-based-targeting/) is the spillover of a project that we started during the 2019 workshop.

This year the workshop will be in *Madrid, Spain, from 24 to 28 June, and **I will be joining as a tutor for a project on social interactions**.
Have a look at mine and others' projects [here](https://complexity72h.com/projects/).
