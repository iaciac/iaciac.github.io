I am super excited to announce the 1st edition of **CRAB: Complexity Research in Animal Behaviour**! 

[CRAB 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/crab2024/home) has been selected as a Satellite event at the [Conference ComplexSystems 2024](https://ccs24.cssociety.org/) (CCS), which will be held in Exeter, UK, from September 2nd to 6th, 2024, and will be a cross-disciplinary meeting to encourage greater exchange between the fields of **Complexity** and **Animal Behaviour**.

While massive steps forward have happened in applying complex systems approaches —such as social network analysis— to study animal behaviour, there remains limited exchange between the research fields!

**The call for abstracts is [now open](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=crab2024)!**
Are you working Animal social networks, Collective animal behaviour, Animal communication, Animal cognition, Disease ecology, Evolutionary biology, or related topics? Send us an abstract to give a contributed presentation!
