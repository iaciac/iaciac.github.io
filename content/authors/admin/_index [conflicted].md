I am a physicist with a strong interest in applied sciences. My research deals with **Complex Networks**, **Data Science** and their application to the study and modeling of social and urban systems.

I am an Associate Professor in the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at [Northeastern University London](https://www.nulondon.ac.uk/) and Affiliated Faculty in the [Department of Physics](https://cos.northeastern.edu/physics/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

Previously, I have been a [James S. McDonnell Foundation](https://www.jsmf.org/) Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Department of Network and Data Science](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/), CEU. I received my PhD from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queen Mary University of London, where I worked within the [Complex Systems and Networks Research Group](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/research/complex-systems-and-networks-group/) under the supervision of [Vito Latora](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~latora/). I have held research positions at the [Centre de Physique Th√©orique](http://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/?lang=en) of Aix-Marseille University, at the [Urban Dynamics Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/urban-dynamics-lab/) of the [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)](http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa), UCL, at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London), and at the [ISI Foundation](http://www.isi.it/en/home) in Turin. I also worked as a Data Science Intern at [UN Universal Postal Union](http://www.upu.int/en.html) in Bern.
